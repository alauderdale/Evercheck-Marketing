						EverCheck’s system is reliable. Historically, our system has maintained an uptime of more than 99%. That means more than 99% of the time, you can feel confident that you and your staff’s workflow won’t be disrupted.

						Customize your EverCheck experience. 
					%p.small
						Your organization’s hierarchy is unique, so a one-size-fits-all solution probably isn’t the right one. EverCheck gives administrators flexible system controls, so you can dictate what level of visibility and authority each user has over EverCheck’s features.

						Transfer data securely.

						EverCheck uses a Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) to transfer your sensitive data over a secure data stream. Your information is protected both in transit and at rest.

						Authenticate with single sign-on. 
					%p.small
						Add an extra layer of security with EverCheck’s single sign-on and require users to authenticate their EverCheck access through your organization’s existing network. Manage password security and give users the luxury of one less password to remember.
